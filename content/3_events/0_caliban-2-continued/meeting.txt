Notes: We will be meeting this Sunday to continue our discussion of Chapter 2 of Caliban and the Witch. If you miss it, then you might just get pauperized! That said, please be sure to finish all of the second chapter by this Sunday. Attached are notes from Emmett's presentation on the Cathars. And, on another note, Ryan shared this trailer to a recent movie by the activist Astra Taylor that features Silvia Federici (she is the person discussing the fresco painting in one of the scenes).  We look forward to thwarting the state with all of you, Sunday!
