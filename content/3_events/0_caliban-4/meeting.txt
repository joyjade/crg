Notes: Dear bodies of affinity, It brings me great pleasure to announce that this Sunday, we shall shed ourselves of the prejudices we hold that subject our bodies to the status of mere tools and recognize in ourselves the affinities that connect our corporeal structures with that of the greater life-worlds in which we inhabit---be there.
