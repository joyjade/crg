Subtitle: The following are a series of reflections, rooted in my experience working at various museums and organizing with the MOCA Union. They come out of conversations with other people, and they are ongoing. Throughout these reflections I look back at various archives to consider the limits and possibilities of unionizing, with the acknowledgement that one is never starting from scratch, but is always operating within a long history of organizing.

Some of the reasons my coworkers and I decided to unionize at The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA) included low wages, lack of transparency, lack of job security and health and safety concerns. Despite our precarious working conditions, there is a longstanding misconception that museum and cultural workers do not have a place in the labor movement.&nbsp;<\/p>"},"id":"99630203-0a55-4caf-b42c-1c4a3bd708e5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Playing into the idea that one\u2019s work isn\u2019t labor is an old and effective way to destabilize organizing efforts. In the early 1970s when the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) staff union, the Professional and Administrative Staff Association (PASTA) wanted curators to be included in the bargaining unit, the board refused to recognize curators as \u201cworkers\u201d, instead associating them with managers.<span class=\"tooltip\">\u00b2<\/span> At one point, PASTA members were asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it might have been more relevant for the PASTA not to have gone into the classical trade union situation?\u201d This question presumes that unions are a bit \u201cold fashioned\u201d, geared towards manual labor and not appropriate for museum workers.\u00a0"},"id":"e7c3de45-d428-4bf4-af84-ca652e611be2","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In my experience working as a museum educator leading tours, visitors often ask if I am doing my job as a volunteer (when I give tours I am usually smiling and providing an experience and to some visitors this gives the illusion that I am not at work).

Andrea Fraser takes up the role of the museum docent in <em>Museum Highlights: a gallery talk<\/em>. Fraser assumes the persona of Jane Castleton, a volunteer museum docent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Throughout the video Fraser adopts certain postures and expressions, revealing how the volunteer docent produces \u201cbourgeois subjecthood\u201d and the \u201cideological role of the museum.\u201d Fraser writes: \u201cA volunteer docent is not just someone who gives tours for a small percentage of the museum visitors; she is the museum representative\u2026[She] is a figure of identification for the primarily white, middle-class audience\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>"},"id":"4b9ae845-c355-4a48-a01f-634dcdb6be00","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"images":["fraser_muhi-fount300.jpg","andrea.png"]},"id":"3b2a3bc1-a71c-4163-bece-ba3b7c0a6a0e","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I used to give tours of <em>Museum Highlights <\/em>at MOCA. I tried to engage with the work in a self-reflexive way, explaining to visitors that my own job was the subject of critique. At MOCA, my main role is to facilitate and listen to visitors, rather than present information in a top-down, lecture format. But as much as my job at MOCA tries to move away from the role Fraser critiques, it is still implicated, especially as it remains low-paid, part-time, contracted, and unpaid at many institutions. The material conditions of the job make it largely inaccessible to people who cannot afford to work in such a precarious position, devaluing the field of museum pedagogy and reinforcing the idea that this is a \u201cprestigious\u201d job, or not even a job at all.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br>The problem with volunteer docents is structural, not personal. The docent position, similar to other jobs within education, is consistently undervalued and discounted as labor partially because it is assumed to be done out of love and care. Work that fits into this \u201clabor of love\u201d narrative is historically feminized and unpaid.

If workers are not happy with their jobs it\u2019s an individual and personal failing, unrelated to the material conditions of their workplace.&nbsp;<\/p><p>These already precarious conditions were amplified at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers have been asked to risk their lives to go back to school with unsafe reopening plans and to work at overcrowded schools that haven\u2019t had repairs, expected to make up for the gaps in the social safety net by loving the kids they teach. Last April MoMA terminated all the contracts of its freelance educators, offering no promise of reemployment.<\/p>"},"id":"bca670b2-1747-43e2-9d39-5484b8cd221d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"2. \u201cWe make bargaining agreements, not revolutions\u201d"},"id":"c942887f-d700-491f-acc1-b0947e64a784","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In the 1960s United Auto Workers (UAW) president Walter Reuther said, \u201cWe make bargaining agreements, not revolutions.\u201d At the time, UAW\u2019s executive board was almost exclusively white and male, more concerned with \u201cdisciplining its members than challenging the companies.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>Just as we must interrogate management\u2019s language around unions, it also seems crucial to think about unionizing as an ongoing project that must constantly be reconsidered. While divisions are obstacles to organizing, one must account for the divisions that do emerge in the workplace, specifically divisions of labor by race and gender. Unionizing should empower workers, and workers should be critical of hierarchies and limitations that emerge within their union.<\/p><p>The Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) was an organization of Black autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan, growing out of the Black Power Movement a year after the 1967 Detroit riots. DRUM argued that UAW did not focus on the discrimination Black workers faced. DRUM also expressed strong opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam, calling on the UAW to organize a general strike to immediately end the war. In 1969, DRUM\u2019s leaders created the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. They were targeted by the police, who defended Big Auto and the UAW.&nbsp;<\/p>"},"id":"40b75ce9-f177-489c-b715-20da4c3b513f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"images":["uaw_local_3_strike_2_bigger.jpg","uaw_local_3_strike_1970_bigger.jpg"]},"id":"c2be116d-e751-4de6-add8-54363767645b","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The history of DRUM speaks to the ways that racism and classism are interconnected, to the shortcomings of their union, and to the possibility of organizing outside the walls of the workplace and in one\u2019s community. There are ongoing conversations around how unions might be pushed in a more radical direction. There is the call to disband police unions, for example, which have historically stood in opposition to racial and economic justice. In June of 2020 the longshoremen in Oakland shut down their ports in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. There have been recent conversations about Bargaining for the Common Good, which proposes that workers should not only see their bargaining demands in relation to workplace issues, but also issues in their communities, such as policing and gentrification. There are, ultimately, limits to a contract itself. Dana Kopel from the New Museum Union acknowledges, \u201ca union contract operates within the capitalist framework in which we all live\u201d but can be seen as \u201cone tactic among many, from petitions and social media campaigns to work stoppages and strikes.\u201d<\/p>"},"id":"0748c6ed-c389-40b3-9416-4b615ebf1980","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"3.

Thursdays were longer than other shifts because the museum stayed open until 8pm and was free for the last three hours. There was usually an influx of visitors, which meant things were often chaotic. At the end of the night I would rush to the elevator with my co-workers, all dressed in uniform, and we would leave the museum together. Then the crowd quickly dissipated and people ran to the bus, or to the parking lot across the street.&nbsp;<\/p><p>A few years later, when we first went public as a union, around one hundred workers from various departments marched in uniform from across the street to the upstairs offices at MOCA. Posts on social media started circulating immediately after, mostly images of us in a crowd standing together outside.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Looking back at these experiences I feel a sense of loss. The pandemic happened shortly after we declared our intent to unionize and many of us were laid off and have since left MOCA to work elsewhere. We are continuing our organizing work, but most of it takes place online. More fundamentally, this sense of loss comes from the acknowledgement that crowds are always fleeting, or as Jodi Dean writes, \u201cthe crowd is a temporary collective being.\u201d Dean speaks of the limits and possibilities of the crowd in relation to the Occupy Movement, explaining that the crowd itself does not have a politics, rather it is an event or a rupture that opens up the potential for politics.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Seeing ourselves in a crowd affirmed our collective power as workers and made it apparent that changing the entire field of cultural labor requires museum workers to understand their issues as shared rather than individual. In their mission statement the New Museum Union writes:<\/p><p>We believe that fair compensation for all workers throughout the museum is essential to ensuring its diversity: salaries, wages, and benefits at the museum must be sustainable for everyone, regardless of the privileges afforded them by race, class, or gender.<\/p><p>Museum workers across the country are organizing with trade unions that represent workers in various sectors, forging alliances between white-collar and blue-collar workers and pushing up against myths and demarcations around what counts as labor. Many museum workers in New York are unionizing with UAW which represents technical, office, and professional workers, including the professional and administrative staff of the MoMA, the New Museum, the Bronx Museum, the New-York Historical Society, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, and more recently, at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Maine PMA, MASS MoCA, Anthology Film Archives, the Hispanic Society of America, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Brooklyn Museum. The MOCA Union organized with AFSCME, which represents nurses, EMTs, sanitation workers, library workers, and employees at the Brooklyn Museum, the Bronx Zoo, the Walker Art Center, and the Philadelphia Art Museum. We might also think about solidarity between garment laborers at Guess Jeans sweatshops, run by the Marciano Brothers, and workers at the Marciano Foundation who lost their jobs after attempting to unionize with AFSCME when the Marcianos abruptly closed the Foundation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Solidarity takes various forms: conversations with workers at other museums to offer advice about the unionization process, mutual aid funds, showing up to bargaining sessions on zoom every week, and always interrogating the ways we relate to our work, our unions, and each other.&nbsp;<\/p><p>A comrade recently said, \u201cthe goal of unionizing is to make material what management tries to abstract\u201d. I was reminded of an interview where Sarah Jaffe remarks, \u201cwork wont\u2019 love you back but other people will\u201d and discussed solidarity as a form of love, as showing up and putting oneself on the line for other people, even people one doesn\u2019t know.<\/p>"},"id":"e38da7e1-190b-414d-884a-6f204fa0bab8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_3328-1.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":null,"link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"34df45b3-39c0-4e32-92bc-1241810de1a5","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Some
