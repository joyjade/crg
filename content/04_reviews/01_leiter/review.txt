Subtitle: The following are a series of reflections, rooted in my experience working at various museums and organizing with the MOCA Union. They come out of conversations with other people, and they are ongoing. Throughout these reflections I look back at various archives to consider the limits and possibilities of unionizing, with the acknowledgement that one is never starting from scratch but is always operating within a long history of organizing.

Some of the reasons my coworkers and I decided to unionize at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) included low wages, lack of transparency, lack of job security, and health and safety concerns.

Andrea Fraser takes up the role of the museum docent in <em>Museum Highlights: a gallery talk<\/em>. In her performance, Fraser assumes the persona of Jane Castleton, a volunteer museum docent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

But as much as my job tries to move away from the role Fraser critiques, it is still implicated, especially as it remains low-paid, part-time, contracted, and unpaid at many institutions. The material conditions of the job make it largely inaccessible to people who cannot afford to work in such a precarious position, devaluing the field of museum pedagogy and reinforcing the idea that this is a \u201cprestigious\u201d job\u2014or not even a job at all.&nbsp;<\/p>","indented":"false"},"id":"ea10fe60-0afc-40ef-9338-6f6cc00ec5b3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The problem with volunteer docents is structural, not personal.

If workers are not happy with their jobs it\u2019s an individual and personal failing, unrelated to the material conditions of their workplace.&nbsp;<\/p><p>These already precarious conditions were amplified at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers have been asked to risk their lives to go back to school with unsafe reopening plans and to work at overcrowded schools that haven\u2019t had repairs, expected to make up for the gaps in the social safety net by loving the kids they teach.

While divisions are obstacles to organizing, one must account for the divisions that do emerge in the workplace, specifically divisions of labor by race and gender.\u00b9\u00b2 Unionizing should empower workers, and workers should be critical of hierarchies and limitations that emerge within their union.\n\nThe Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) was an organization of Black autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan, growing out of the Black Power Movement a year after the 1967 Detroit riots. DRUM argued that UAW did not focus on the discrimination Black workers faced.\u00b9\u00b3 DRUM also expressed strong opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam, calling on the UAW to organize a general strike to immediately end the war. In 1969, DRUM\u2019s leaders created the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. They were targeted by the police, who defended Big Auto and the UAW.\u00a0"},"id":"f610a893-f9c7-4838-95da-e6bed415b084","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["uaw_local_3_strike_2_bigger.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"Black and white photograph of DRUM workers on strike ","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false","size":"","padding":"top"},"id":"c4d1822e-337d-4ce9-ad8b-b35a59b97a24","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["uaw_local_3_strike_1970_bigger.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"Black and white photograph of DRUM workers on strike.

There are ongoing conversations around how unions might be pushed in a more radical direction. There is the call to disband police unions, for example, which have historically stood in opposition to racial and economic justice.\u00b9\u2074 In June of 2020 the longshoremen in Oakland shut down their ports in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.\u00b9\u2075 There have been recent conversations about Bargaining for the Common Good,\u00b9\u2076 which proposes that workers should not only see their bargaining demands in relation to workplace issues but also issues in their communities, such as policing and gentrification. There are, ultimately, limits to a contract itself. Dana Kopel from the New Museum Union acknowledges, \u201ca union contract operates within the capitalist framework in which we all live\u201d but can be seen as \u201cone tactic among many, from petitions and social media campaigns to work stoppages and strikes.\u201d\u00b9\u2077"},"id":"0748c6ed-c389-40b3-9416-4b615ebf1980","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"3.

Thursdays were longer than other shifts because the museum stayed open until 8 p.m. and was free for the last three hours. There was usually an influx of visitors, which meant things were often chaotic. At the end of the night I would rush to the elevator with my co-workers, all dressed in uniform, and we would leave the museum together. Then the crowd quickly dissipated, and people ran to the bus or to the parking lot across the street.&nbsp;<\/p><p>A few years later, when we first went public as a union, around one hundred workers from various departments marched in uniform from across the street to the upstairs offices at MOCA. Posts on social media started circulating immediately after, mostly images of us in a crowd standing together outside.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Looking back at these experiences I feel a sense of loss. The pandemic happened shortly after we declared our intent to unionize and many of us were laid off and have since left MOCA to work elsewhere. We are continuing our organizing work, but most of it takes place online. More fundamentally, this sense of loss comes from the acknowledgement that crowds are always fleeting or as Jodi Dean writes, \u201cthe crowd is a temporary collective being.\u201d\u00b9\u2078 Dean speaks of the limits and possibilities of the crowd in relation to the Occupy Movement, explaining that the crowd itself does not have a politics, rather it is an event or a rupture that opens up the potential for politics.<\/p><p>Seeing ourselves in a crowd affirmed our collective power as workers and made it apparent that changing the entire field of cultural labor requires museum workers to understand their issues as shared rather than individual.

Many museum workers in New York are unionizing with UAW which represents technical, office, and professional workers, including the professional and administrative staff of the MoMA, the New Museum, the Bronx Museum, the New-York Historical Society, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, and more recently, at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Maine PMA, MASS MoCA, Anthology Film Archives, the Hispanic Society of America, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Brooklyn Museum. The MOCA Union organized with AFSCME, which represents nurses, EMTs, sanitation workers, library workers, and employees at the Brooklyn Museum, the Bronx Zoo, the Walker Art Center, and the Philadelphia Art Museum. We might also think about solidarity between garment laborers at Guess Jeans sweatshops, run by the Marciano Brothers, and workers at the Marciano Foundation who lost their jobs after attempting to unionize with AFSCME when the Marcianos abruptly closed the Foundation.\u00b2\u2070<\/p><p>Solidarity takes various forms: conversations with workers at other museums to offer advice about the unionization process, mutual aid funds, showing up to bargaining sessions on Zoom every week, and always interrogating the ways we relate to our work, our unions, and each other.&nbsp;<\/p><p>A comrade recently said, \u201cThe goal of unionizing is to make material what management tries to abstract.\u201d I was reminded of an interview where Sarah Jaffe remarks, \u201cWork won\u2019t love
