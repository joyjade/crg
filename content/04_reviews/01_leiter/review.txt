I remember leaving my job at a restaurant in Boston a few years ago to work at an art museum. Everyone congratulated me, but I was making the same amount of money, less without tips, and on Thursdays my boss enforced a 3-hour break in the middle of the day to avoid paying overtime.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Employees at art institutions are consistently underpaid, overworked and are often juggling several part-time jobs at once. Some of the reasons my coworkers and I decided to unionize at The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA) included low wages, lack of transparency, lack of job security and health and safety concerns. Despite our precarious working conditions, there is a longstanding misconception that museum and cultural workers do not have a place in the labor movement.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Playing into the idea that one\u2019s work isn\u2019t labor is an old and effective way to destabilize organizing efforts. In the early 1970s when the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) staff union, the Professional and Administrative Staff Association (PASTA) wanted curators to be included in the bargaining unit, the board refused to recognize curators as \u201cworkers\u201d, instead associating them with managers. At one point, PASTA members were asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it might have been more relevant for the PASTA not to have gone into the classical trade union situation?\u201d This question presumes that unions are a bit \u201cold fashioned\u201d, geared towards manual labor and not appropriate for museum workers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In my experience working as a museum educator leading tours, visitors often ask if I am doing my job as a volunteer (when I give tours I am usually smiling and providing an experience and to some visitors this gives the illusion that I am not at work). In actuality there <em>are <\/em>many volunteer docents who work at cultural institutions. Every year around 300 people \u201capply\u201d for 30 docent positions at the Met.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Volunteer docents usually fit into a specific demographic: white, older, female, and upper-middle class. Andrea Fraser takes up the role of the museum docent in <em>Museum Highlights: a gallery talk<\/em>. Fraser assumes the persona of Jane Castleton, a volunteer museum docent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Throughout the video Fraser adopts certain postures and expressions, revealing how the volunteer docent produces \u201cbourgeois subjecthood\u201d and the \u201cideological role of the museum.\u201d Fraser writes: \u201cA volunteer docent is not just someone who gives tours for a small percentage of the museum visitors; she is the museum representative\u2026[She] is a figure of identification for the primarily white, middle-class audience\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>"},"id":"8c418397-7104-4270-91d4-ba33d23d3f69","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["andrea.png"],"src":"","alt":"andrea fraser pontificating in a musuem","caption":"Andrea Fraser caption","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"a39dd217-7d43-48d6-a0e9-ffd14f5a92b1","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
