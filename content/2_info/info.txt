Text: THE COMMUNITY READING GROUP reads and discusses philosophical investigations of the concept in community in popular, poltical, and legal rhetoric. We focus on scholars who complicate positive invocations o community, such as community building, resilience, preservation, health, or rights. Our aim is to foster an approachable space for an individual of any background to challenge their own inherited ideas around common being 1.
