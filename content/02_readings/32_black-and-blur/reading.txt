“Coming together each week with the Community Reading Group has propped me up when I really needed it this year. I appreciate the little extra motivation, accountability, and joy of gathering for discourse with a group of insightful people who show up for nothing more than the communal commitment we make to each other. I think of our project as studying the material histories that create the conditions of our time, and what it means to be a body, in a social body, in the world today. I’m excited for our next book, Black and Blur by Fred Moten, because I trust that the group will help fill in my own knowledge gaps, and offer a context for a richer experience of the book.”
