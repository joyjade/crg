Note:

"I wanted to share with you and the group that my interest in these readings is based on my own dive into disability justice this year. I am immunocompromised and identify as disabled, although “invisibly.” This material / biological difference being heightened during the pandemic, I’ve been interested in readings that offer insight on our collective relationship with illness - the social control of our bodies and split between body & mind - and the necessity / possibility of community care through mutual aid (Care Work)."
