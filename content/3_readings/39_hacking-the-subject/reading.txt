Blurb: My favorite structure for my life is when it's 1/3 volunteering (investing in community), and 1/3 making art (praxis), and 1/3 meandering research (burning questions). For the last third, I wish to contemplate ideas like accountability, vulnerability, and neurodivergence. And I hope to bring these terms to bear on questions of what it might look like to foster everyday relationships that further the possibility of an anti-capitalist future.
