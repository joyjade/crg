Author: A Workshop with Aimee Bahng

Subtitle: Toward a Relational Environmentalism

Note:

Octavia E. Butler was fascinated by the speculative worlds made possible by slime molds, anglerfish, and other category-defying species in the Kingdom Protista. In the taxonomic projects of nineteenth century Europe, science and empire became intertwined, cataloging everything from “exotic” flora and fauna during scientific expeditions to the world beyond Europe. 

This critical reading workshop considers the nonhierarchical socialities offered by Octavia Butler’s work, while following human encounters with Kingdom Protista that illuminate the concurrently unfolding histories of U.S. imperialism, computational science, global racial capitalism, and ecosystems engineering that run on logics of containment, enclosure, and improvement. Along the way, questions of human relationships to other species, our legacies of racial ecologies, and how humans might most ethically meet our remaining time on Earth.
