Title: Toward a Black Feminist Poethics

Subtitle: The Quest(ion) of Blackness Toward the End of the World

Note: *“From without the World as we know it, where the Category of Blackness exists in/as thought—always already a referent of commodity, an object, and the other, as fact beyond evidence—a Poethics of Blackness would announce a whole range of possibilities for knowing, doing, and existing.”*

Blurb: My favorite structure for my life is when it's 1/3 volunteering (investing in community), and 1/3 making art (praxis), and 1/3 meandering research (burning questions). For the last third, I wish to contemplate ideas like accountability, vulnerability, and neurodivergence. And I hope to bring these terms to bear on questions of what it might look like to foster everyday relationships that further the possibility of an anti-capitalist future.
