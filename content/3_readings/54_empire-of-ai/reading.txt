Blurb:

Community for me is a term of ever shifting scale. I fluidly define my community as my closest friendships, my wider social networks, people laboring in other parts of the world creating the physical/technological objects of my daily life, and all the non-human beings and environments that share the same air, water and earth as me.  

As the creation and use of AI is ever more pervasive in all of these communities, I’m looking for a deeper understanding of it and a responsible engagement in the topic that moves beyond my individual actions. Even if I personally never use AI intentionally, AI is a force in the world that has become unavoidable.
