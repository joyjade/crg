Blurb: I have long been interested in how secular political concepts are often rooted in older religious ones, most notably the idea of *community* itself, which is entangled in preoccupations with wholeness but once had a much older connotation of debt. I am excited by books that offer the opportunity to take seriously the creative potential of being in debt *with* others.
