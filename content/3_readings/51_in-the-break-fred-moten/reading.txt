Title: In the Break

Author: Fred Moten

Subtitle: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition

----

Note:

Fred Moten investigates the provocative connections between jazz, sexual identity, and radical black politics. He focuses in particular on the brilliant improvisatory jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, and others, arguing that all black performance—culture, politics, sexuality, identity, and blackness itself—is improvisation.

Blurb:

The book I’m offering is based on the thread in CRG’s mission statement that connects the group's interest in the complications of community and the commonness, grounded in a reexamination of our received terms and lived experiences via close readings and discussions.


Simply said, I am curious about how we live and make our way in the world—in this instance, I’m reflecting on how we recognize ourselves and one another across our adjacencies, how communities arise, teem with differentiations and reflexively iterate—like the ship Argo.
