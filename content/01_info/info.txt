Mission:

Convening every Sunday, the Community Reading Group is a gathering committed to the study of community as a political category in popular, philosophical, and legal discourse. We focus on literature that complicates invocations of community as the proper aim of activism. Examples include: community building, resilience, preservation, health, or rights. As readers, we come from a wide spectrum of professions and interests; however, most commonly, many of us are involved in three—arguably interlocking—movements: the fight to defend housing as a right, to protect education from labor exploitation, and to overturn inequitable structures in arts institutions.

Whether by chance or by correlation, the fact that so many of our members, who work for “the public good,” claim the above struggles as their own suggests a far-reaching urgency to confront community’s most supposedly self-evident corollaries anew: the individual, the family, the public, the private, the state, and, most importantly, commonness as such. Taking our cue from the spirit of the tertulia—literary, social gatherings that were a critical locus for anticolonial thought in South America—we aim to foster an approachable space for anyone to join us in challenging one another’s inherited ideas around common being. If you are someone who loves the exercise of close reading a text, then this is the place for you.

History:

In 2018, the Community Reading Group began as a general interest study group to explore the continental response to the communitarian debates in the Anglophone world throughout the 1980s and 90s. Our first meeting was supported by the Liberation School of Los Angeles and generously hosted by Skira Martinez, Director of CIELO Galleries and Studios in Boyle Heights. (The impetus to form this initial meet-up would have never come into fruition if it were not for the encouragement of artist Hans Kuzmich, to whom a special debt is owed.) In 2019, we moved to our permanent home at the Los Angeles Contemporary Archive in Chinatown.

Over time our numbers ebbed and flowed; nevertheless, a steady stream of new arrivals kept our philosophical pursuits alive. Today, our focus has shifted away from communitarianism and towards philosophies of freedom, histories of emancipatory struggle, and theorizations of the commons. We have amassed a consistent and committed group of intellectuals who attend our weekly seminar and are integrating the question of community in their praxis in their own way. In addition, our focus has broadened beyond the mere discussion of scholarship and is now aimed towards discursive production. While many voices have shaped and perfected our project, some deserve to be amplified in particular; they are Olivia Leiter, Joy Park, Hailey Loman, and Michael Berlin.

    LACA is an art archive, library, and
    exhibition platform that collects
    underexposed artistic modes of
    expression happening in our current
    moment. Challenging established concepts
    of the archive and art space, LACA
    sustains a unique experimental
    environment for critical inquiry,
    artistic research, and public dialogue.
    The collection at LACA is artist–run,
    meaning that living artists are
    donating, deciding what is valuable and
    generating language for inventorying
    their work on their own terms. LACA is
    not affiliated with a larger institution
    and as such, it maintains an archive
    free from limitations associated with
    prevailing, traditional structures.

Faq:

*When does the Community Reading Group (CRG) meet? *

We meet every Sunday from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. either online or in-person or both. Instructions for upcoming meetings will be sent out by email on Tuesdays with a reminder sent Sunday mornings.  

*Do I have to read the current book to participate in CRG? *

CRG members are committed to joint study—genuine engagement with the interests of others is core to our mission. However, “engagement” may take other forms than reading, and we regularly share working notes so anyone can follow along. Please be mindful, however, to make space for those who have read. That being said, we encourage you to join us as you are. We are always thrilled for new faces and perspectives. 

*What does CRG do that other reading groups do not already provide? *

CRG is both a reading group and a reflexive space in which we try to enact the questions we ask. Our central questions are the following:
How does community signify commonness?
How does invoking community further democracy?
How might we comprehend community more expansively?
How might we commit our community activism to this expanse?

*How is LACA different from CRG and vice versa? *

LACA is an art archive and library that hosts CRG in person in its reading room and online. CRG is an experimental study group whose focus informs and enhances the social commitments of LACA. 

*I missed a few books but want to jump into the new reading. Is that okay? And is it okay to participate here and there? Sometimes I can be consistent. *

CRG is open to join at any time. We do not have expectations regarding your bandwidth and are just happy when you can join us. 

*How does the book selection process work? *

Our course of study is collective, which means that we vote on the books we read. After each book is finished, the organizer nominates someone to propose several books to be subject to a vote. Once the winner is decided, members have one to two weeks to procure a physical copy of the book, although digital copies will always be made available. The intervening week(s) between each member’s turn is dedicated to CRG programming, namely guest speakers or presentations by participants (e.g., group crits or workshops). 

*When do I get to pick a book?*

Participants who commit themselves to reading and discussing at least two books in succession are given priority for book selection. (Selections do not necessarily need to be a book; they may also take the form of an article, a film, an exhibition, or music [provided that all are accessible online].) 

*I am interested in starting a CRG in my neck of the woods. Would this be supported by CRG?*

Absolutely! And, in fact, our ultimate goal is to help others build their own CRG gatherings. We are especially interested in supporting a Spanish language branch of this project. So, if our vision for the collective study of political language speaks to you, then please reach out to us. We will help you grow it.
