Mission:

Convening every Sunday, the Community Reading Group is a gathering committed to the study of community as a political category in popular, philosophical, and legal discourse. We focus on literature that complicates invocations of community as the proper aim of activism. Examples include: community building, resilience, preservation, health, or rights. As readers, we come from a wide spectrum of professions and interests; however, most commonly, many of us are involved in three—arguably interlocking—movements: the fight to defend housing as a right, to protect education from labor exploitation, and to overturn inequitable structures in arts institutions.

Whether by chance or by correlation, the fact that so many of our members, who work for “the public good,” claim the above struggles as their own suggests a far-reaching urgency to confront community’s most supposedly self-evident corollaries anew: the individual, the family, the public, the private, the state, and, most importantly, commonness as such. Taking our cue from the spirit of the tertulia—literary, social gatherings that were a critical locus for anticolonial thought in South America—we aim to foster an approachable space for anyone to join us in challenging one another’s inherited ideas around common being. If you are someone who loves the exercise of close reading a text, then this is the place for you.

History:

In 2018, the Community Reading Group began as a general interest study group to explore the continental response to the communitarian debates in the Anglophone world throughout the 1980s and 90s. Our first meeting was supported by the Liberation School of Los Angeles and generously hosted by Skira Martinez, Director of CIELO Galleries and Studios in Boyle Heights. (The impetus to form this initial meet-up would have never come into fruition if it were not for the encouragement of artist Hans Kuzmich, to whom a special debt is owed.) In 2019, we moved to our permanent home at the Los Angeles Contemporary Archive in Chinatown.

Over time our numbers ebbed and flowed; nevertheless, a steady stream of new arrivals kept our philosophical pursuits alive. Today, our focus has shifted away from communitarianism and towards philosophies of freedom, histories of emancipatory struggle, and theorizations of the commons. We have amassed a consistent and committed group of intellectuals who attend our weekly seminar and are integrating the question of community in their praxis in their own way. In addition, our focus has broadened beyond the mere discussion of scholarship and is now aimed towards discursive production. While many voices have shaped and perfected our project, some deserve to be amplified in particular; they are Olivia Leiter, Joy Park, Hailey Loman, and Michael Berlin.

    LACA is an art archive, library, and
    exhibition platform that collects
    underexposed artistic modes of
    expression happening in our current
    moment. Challenging established concepts
    of the archive and art space, LACA
    sustains a unique experimental
    environment for critical inquiry,
    artistic research, and public dialogue.
    The collection at LACA is artist–run,
    meaning that living artists are
    donating, deciding what is valuable and
    generating language for inventorying
    their work on their own terms. LACA is
    not affiliated with a larger institution
    and as such, it maintains an archive
    free from limitations associated with
    prevailing, traditional structures.
