Bio:

Alex Delapena’s work focuses on scuffs, imprints and smears, material traces of movement in the built environment. Hues of gray blur into each other and coalesce into a tactile field, describing the experience of coming to understand the world through sensory engagement. 

Delapena’s most recent exhibitions include After Afterlife at The Fulcrum Press, Los Angeles, Escape, Photographic Exploration Project at Tête Gallery, Berlin, Germany and Boundary Artifacts at 3331 Arts Chioyoda, Tokyo, Japan. Delapena lives and works in Los Angeles.
