About:

Community Bookmarks explores the various ways contemporary artists approach the bookmark format. 

The earliest bookmark dates back to the 6th century AD, and its use became more prevalent with the rise of literacy. Today, the bookmark can be generally understood as any tool to keep track and take notes. Community Bookmarks calls attention to the value of marginalia and ephemeraâ€“to underlines, annotations, references, and footnotes. 

All proceeds from this fundraiser will go directly towards CRG programming, which is free and open to the public.
